# 🔋 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset related to **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** to uncover insights about electric range, energy consumption, pricing, and efficiency. Using **Python** for data exploration and statistical modeling, the goal is to identify trends, test hypotheses, and derive actionable recommendations for the EV industry.

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Verified data types and cleaned missing values
- Understood key features like EV range, price, and consumption

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values with appropriate imputation techniques
- Checked for outliers and corrected formatting issues

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plotted distributions of EV range and energy usage
- Analyzed correlation between **price** and **range**
- Used box plots, scatter plots, and histograms for visual insights

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Tested if premium EVs have significantly higher range or energy efficiency
- Conducted t-tests to compare groups based on vehicle characteristics

### 5. Insights & Recommendations
- Identified pricing bands where efficiency is optimized
- Highlighted areas for design improvements and energy optimization
- Suggested affordability-efficiency trade-offs for manufacturers

## 🔍 Key Insights

- EVs with higher battery capacity generally have better range, but with diminishing returns at higher price points
- Significant correlation found between **price and energy consumption**
- Mid-priced EVs tend to balance performance and energy use better than the extremes
